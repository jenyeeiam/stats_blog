Beware, personal opinions ahead.

As you might know, I love side projects. I start a lot of them. Most don't survive. For obvious reasons I keep coming back to projects that are centered around softball with a mix of what I do now, make software! Whilst I work on these side projects, I often seek out guidance to get opinions on direction, focus testing if it's an app, or in this case, data for analysis. Using this project as an example, I'm seeing that the bookkeeping for softball stats is pretty non existent. This surprises me for two reasons, the first is the advancement of technology in general has made collecting data much easier than it was in the past, the second is that it seems are not many people asking for this data to prompt the collection of historical data in the first place. There is no shortage of internet folks who have plenty of good questions, and data is the best resource we have in order to even attempt at answering our questions.

The tech industry lives on data, it is how apps are made. Facebook data is user generated (for better or worse), at Netflix they buy or create their own content and wrap it up in a platform for our viewing pleasure. If there were no users there would be no Facebook, no movies, no Netflix. In addition, Facebook has an API in which you can tap into and use the data for your own use. Say for example you're a machine learning engineer, what if you could download all the photos of your Facebook friends, train a photo recognition algorithm and draw funny mustaches on all of your Facebook friends' selfies. Not a multi million dollar app idea but in theory you should be able to do this**.    

Check out the [Kaggle datasets][datasets], there are datasets for everything under the sun. Data scientists and enthusiasts go there and build visualizations, algorithms, or generally to solve problems. Lately, many datasets have been released related to COVID-19 with an open call to help find anything useful the government or health professionals can use during the pandemic. You might be wondering why would people want to do this for free? Well I don't know the scientific term, but it's weirdly fun! It's the same reason Wikipedia or Yelp exists, there is something inside of us that enjoys contributing to the cause. As someone who contributes to open source projects and writes Google reviews, there's a little hit of satisfaction adding a little piece to the greater whole.

I would love for the softball community to get onboard with the open source mindset, even a little bit. I would love to see more **friendly** platforms where information can be shared, or opportunities to work on larger projects together. Especially during a time when no one can actually play softball physically, and at a time when the overall enrollment in the sport is declining, now is a great opportunity to come up with creative solutions to stay involved. I think too many times, monetary gains or notoriety become prioritized over the desire to grow softball in a general sense. Charging folks for data or hiding hitting videos behind paywalls creates a larger barrier to entry than there should be. If these platforms already exist then I am severely uninformed, so I'm sorry. You can tweet them at me if you wish.
