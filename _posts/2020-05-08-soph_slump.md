This is one of those iconic sports clichÃ©s. While I do love a good colloquial saying, I'm interested in knowing whether this saying actually holds any water. Disclaimer #1, I don't have defensive stats! All I have to work with is pitching, so that will have to do for now. However, my hypothesis is that pitching stats should be sufficient to draw some conclusions overall. Pitchers are the most important defender, they touch the ball on every single play for half the game and play a major influence in the outcome of the game.

I'd like to answer the following questions, do the best teams that come out of the WCWS have better pitching than all the other teams? What's the most important metric? Have we been saying "Defense wins championships" for nothing this whole time?
