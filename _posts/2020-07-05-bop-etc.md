A few weeks ago, I set out to try and parse the play by play data for the PAC12 2019 season. To start, I wanted to answer two questions. 1. For each batting order position (bop) 1-9, how many times on average does each hitter make a plate appearance? 2. For each bop, how many outs were there when they made the plate appearance? To say I was completely successful would be a lie. But I tried, and like any good softball coach will tell you, "It's about the process not the outcome!"

This post will outline my methodology, assumptions, and things that were frustrating.

#### Methodology
For each game, I stored the starters and their batting order position for each team. Then for each inning I took each sentence, which I assumed equates to a play, and "guessed" what the play is. Below is an example of a inning of play by play data.

To keep track of how many times each player made a plate appearance, I kept a running tally of every time the player's name came up. If you're wondering how I handled the substitutions, my answer is, I didn't. The sentence structure usually went something like, "Halstead, Pa pinch hit for Shaw, Zoe" so if Shaw, Zoe was listed as the starter then she would still be counted as making a plate appearance. In my script, I am making an assumption that the sentence structure would always be this way. This assumption is not 100% correct, but I believe it is capturing most cases and plate appearances. And most of the time is good enough for me.

To guess what type of play it was, I had a list of all the types of possible plays that could happen in a game.

{% highlight ruby %}
play_types = Set[
    'grounded',
    'flied',
    'lined',
    'popped',
    'struck',
    'homer',
    'single',
    'double',
    'triple',
    'reached',
    'walk',
    'fielders'
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

Then, for each sentence I compared each word to all the words in `play_types` where the closest match won. I used string comparisons with Levenshtein distances if anyone is interested. From there, I had another list of words that I knew resulted in outs. Examples of these words would be, `['flied', 'popped', 'struck']` you get the idea. If the `play_type` was one of the words I had in my `outs_list`, then I would mark it as an out. There were cases where hitters would hit into double plays and I had a check for that too. This method of data parsing is messy at best, and having to clean data like this is pretty much a nightmare. The best chance I had at getting this right is if games were low scoring and evenly matched. Joke's on me, softball in 2019 is no where near like this! There were huge blowout games even within conference, and the long innings made for complicated play descriptions. In other words, my data accuracy went down the tube. It was the substitutions especially late in the game that were cause for a lot of covoluted data where even my human brain had trouble following what was going on, so there's really no hope for the computer at that point. Here I will make yet *another* call for better open source data in softball!

#### Results

Below are the results for the number of plate appearances for each batting order position.

|Batting Order Position (BOP)|Plate Appearances per Game (PA/G)
|:-------:|:-------:|
|1|3.78|
|2|3.68|
|3|3.58|
|4|3.46|
|5|3.33|
|6|3.25|
|7|3.17|
|8|3.06|
|9|2.94|

I'm a little bit surprised by these numbers, I thought they would be higher. Maybe because I had this idea in my mind that these teams would be scoring buckets of runs. So I did a check and about 27% of the time these games ended early because of the run rule. And since we know that slugging percentage has gone up over time, I think that justifies these numbers well enough. I wonder if the number of run rule games has increased over time. If only there was comprehensive data records in softball...ðŸ™„

Below is the percentage of times players in each batting order position made plate appearances with 0, 1 and 2 outs.

| Batting Order Position | Out 0% | Out 1% | Out 2% |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | 54.6 | 26.3 | 19.1 |
| 2 | 38.3 | 43.5 | 18.3 |
| 3 | 32.7 | 38.0 | 29.3 |
| 4 | 37.8 | 34.5 | 27.7 |
| 5 | 39.0 | 35.1 | 25.9 |
| 6 | 37.7 | 36.1 | 26.3 |
| 7 | 39.1 | 35.5 | 25.4 |
| 8 | 37.5 | 36.6 | 26.0 |
| 9 | 36.5 | 35.2 | 28.4 |


These numbers are for sure not reliable, especially for the batters later in the order. I was expecting batters 5-9 to have pretty even percentages of plate appearances for each out situation.

But, say this was perfect how could we use this information? Well, we know that lineup efficiency is about placing hitters in the best position so they will make a plate appearance in their appropriately best performing sitation the most frequently. In other words, if Batter Sally performs the best with 2 out you'd want to put her in a position where that situation comes up more often. Of course you'd also want to consider other statistics related to hitting.

#### Conclusion

This post didn't really have any huge takeaways aside from me complaining a lot. I worked on this script for as long as I could handle until giving up, so if anyone has any ideas for processing this data that don't include natural language processing, I'm all ears.
