Here we are, I was successful in parsing the PAC12 2019 season ðŸ¥³! Ok, well what I actually mean by that is I was able to write a script extrac *some* information from their play by play data. For this post, I set out to answer two questions. 1. For each batting order position (bop) 1-9, how many times on average does each hitter make a plate appearance? 2. For each bop, how many outs were there for each of these plate appearances? I will list out some methodologies, assumptions and areas for improvement.

#### Methodology
For each game, I stored the starters and their batting order position for each team. Then for each inning I essentially chunked each sentence, which I assumed equates to a play, and "guessed" what the play is. Below is an example of a inning of play by play data.
